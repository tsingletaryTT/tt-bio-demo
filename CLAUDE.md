structure prediction on a Tenstorrent QB2.

## What happened

### 2026-08-10 — project spun up from a tt-boltz session

Started in `~/code/tt-boltz` with: *"can we make sure this directory / repo is tracking the
recently renamed-to tt-bio project's latest release? I'd like to examine viability for an
automated, visual running demo to leave on in a conference setting."*

That session re-pointed `~/code/tt-boltz` at `moritztng/tt-bio` (the project was renamed
from tt-boltz) and reset it to release **v0.6.2**, keeping the stale local main on branch
`pre-tt-bio-sync-backup`. Viability came back favorable, and the follow-up prompt asked to
spec the demo as its own project here, with debian packaging for turnkey install on a fresh
QB2 — and specifically asked whether we could **avoid a web browser** in favor of an
integrated GTK UI.

### Key decisions

- **Native GTK4 throughout, no WebKit.** The original viability sketch assumed a browser
  panel running Mol* for the 3D view. Taylor pushed back on that, and the native path turned
  out better: one scene graph, one visual language, and the protein is a real widget
  alongside the telemetry rather than an iframe next to it.
- **Two processes, two Python environments.** tt-bio needs a torch/ttnn venv; GTK needs
  system `python3-gi`. Splitting them removes the conflict instead of managing it, and gives
  fault isolation for free — the UI holds no device handles and cannot be taken down by a
  wedged card.
- **Live diffusion trajectory via `dump_fn`.** Discovered while assessing feasibility that
  tt-bio's sampler already exposes `dump_fn(sample, step, coords)` per denoising step in
  `protenix.py`/`opendde.py`. This turns "watch it fold" from decorative animation into the
  actual computation, streamed live. Protenix-v2/OpenDDE only for now; adding the hook to
  the other models is a deliberate out-of-scope follow-up so this project never blocks on
  upstream changes.
- **Point cloud during diffusion, ribbon on completion.** `dump_fn` coordinates come in the
  model's internal atom ordering, so building a ribbon mid-trajectory means reconstructing
  atom→residue mapping — the riskiest code in the project. Rendering raw atoms as points
  during diffusion needs no chemistry at all, and cross-fading to a gemmi-parsed ribbon at
  the end deletes the risk while making the sequence better theatre.
- **Kiosk boot rejected for now.** Desktop app instead; the runner is a supervised
  `systemd --user` service. Less display-stack surface to debug at a venue.
- **Weights via postinst download, not a fat .deb.** Offline operation is required at the
  venue, not at install time.

### Notable moments in prompting

- Taylor pointed at `~/code/tt-local-generator` and `~/code/tt-station` as prior art
  mid-turn. Both paid off immediately: tt-local-generator's `app/activity_viz.py` has a
  working `tt-smi` telemetry sampler (with an AICLK fallback) to port directly, and its
  `debian/` tree is the multi-package + debconf-templates pattern this project copies.
- The interactivity question came back as *"3 but with an attract loop too"* — i.e. a kiosk
  visitors can drive that also runs itself when nobody's there. That answer is what produced
  the four-state machine with a 45-second idle reset.

### 2026-08-11 — Phase 1–2 built (protocol, mock runner, renderer)

Executed the Phase 1–2 plan with subagent-driven development: a fresh implementer per
task, a spec-and-quality review after each, and a whole-branch review at the end.
Ten tasks, 24 commits, 83 tests. The deliverable works: a recorded fold plays back
end to end — noise cloud, contraction, cross-fade, rotating pLDDT ribbon — on any
Linux box with no Tenstorrent hardware attached.

**The review loop found nine genuine bugs in the plan's own code**, not in the
implementations of it. The plan was written carefully and reviewed before execution,
and it was still wrong in nine places. Worth remembering the next time a plan looks
finished:

- `look_at` stored its rotation basis as rows where column-major storage needs
  columns — wrong for every off-axis camera.
- `tube_mesh` wound every triangle backwards; with backface culling the ribbon would
  have been invisible.
- The point-size formula cancelled exactly against the camera distance, pinning atoms
  at ~1.3 px at any zoom. The fold rendered, invisibly.
- `EventClient._run` set state to `"disconnected"` before testing for
  `"incompatible"`, clobbering the flag its own guard checked — infinite reconnects.
- `on_event` was called unguarded, and `unpack_coords` too, either of which silently
  freezes a GLib source forever.
- `clear_structure` reset the blend but not its target, so a second fold faded toward
  a discarded ribbon.
- `_frame_camera`'s streaming ease was reused for the one-shot ribbon, which therefore
  never converged and left the hero image permanently mis-scaled.
- A degenerate leading tangent produced an all-NaN mesh, silently.
- Every command in the plan used bare `python3`, which resolves to a Tenstorrent venv
  lacking gemmi and GTK.

Each fix was applied to the shipped code *and* back to the plan document, so the plan
of record now matches what was built rather than quietly disagreeing with it.

**The recurring failure mode was tests that could not fail.** Four of those bugs
survived a green suite because the test could not distinguish the right answer from
the wrong one. See the last section of [`docs/followups.md`](docs/followups.md).

## Conventions

- Spec-first: brainstormed design → committed spec → implementation plan → code.
- tt-bio is pinned to a **release tag**, never `main` (upstream nightly moves fast).
- Nothing in the UI may ever display a stack trace; every failure path resolves to
  something presentable. See §6 of the spec.
