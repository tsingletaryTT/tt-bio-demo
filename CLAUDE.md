# tt-bio-demo — project log

A turnkey GTK4 conference demo for [tt-bio](https://github.com/moritztng/tt-bio) protein
structure prediction on a Tenstorrent QB2.

Design spec: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-10-tt-bio-demo-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-10-tt-bio-demo-design.md)

## What happened

### 2026-08-10 — project spun up from a tt-boltz session

Started in `~/code/tt-boltz` with: *"can we make sure this directory / repo is tracking the
recently renamed-to tt-bio project's latest release? I'd like to examine viability for an
automated, visual running demo to leave on in a conference setting."*

That session re-pointed `~/code/tt-boltz` at `moritztng/tt-bio` (the project was renamed
from tt-boltz) and reset it to release **v0.6.2**, keeping the stale local main on branch
`pre-tt-bio-sync-backup`. Viability came back favorable, and the follow-up prompt asked to
spec the demo as its own project here, with debian packaging for turnkey install on a fresh
QB2 — and specifically asked whether we could **avoid a web browser** in favor of an
integrated GTK UI.

### Key decisions

- **Native GTK4 throughout, no WebKit.** The original viability sketch assumed a browser
  panel running Mol* for the 3D view. Taylor pushed back on that, and the native path turned
  out better: one scene graph, one visual language, and the protein is a real widget
  alongside the telemetry rather than an iframe next to it.
- **Two processes, two Python environments.** tt-bio needs a torch/ttnn venv; GTK needs
  system `python3-gi`. Splitting them removes the conflict instead of managing it, and gives
  fault isolation for free — the UI holds no device handles and cannot be taken down by a
  wedged card.
- **Live diffusion trajectory via `dump_fn`.** Discovered while assessing feasibility that
  tt-bio's sampler already exposes `dump_fn(sample, step, coords)` per denoising step in
  `protenix.py`/`opendde.py`. This turns "watch it fold" from decorative animation into the
  actual computation, streamed live. Protenix-v2/OpenDDE only for now; adding the hook to
  the other models is a deliberate out-of-scope follow-up so this project never blocks on
  upstream changes.
- **Point cloud during diffusion, ribbon on completion.** `dump_fn` coordinates come in the
  model's internal atom ordering, so building a ribbon mid-trajectory means reconstructing
  atom→residue mapping — the riskiest code in the project. Rendering raw atoms as points
  during diffusion needs no chemistry at all, and cross-fading to a gemmi-parsed ribbon at
  the end deletes the risk while making the sequence better theatre.
- **Kiosk boot rejected for now.** Desktop app instead; the runner is a supervised
  `systemd --user` service. Less display-stack surface to debug at a venue.
- **Weights via postinst download, not a fat .deb.** Offline operation is required at the
  venue, not at install time.

### Notable moments in prompting

- Taylor pointed at `~/code/tt-local-generator` and `~/code/tt-station` as prior art
  mid-turn. Both paid off immediately: tt-local-generator's `app/activity_viz.py` has a
  working `tt-smi` telemetry sampler (with an AICLK fallback) to port directly, and its
  `debian/` tree is the multi-package + debconf-templates pattern this project copies.
- The interactivity question came back as *"3 but with an attract loop too"* — i.e. a kiosk
  visitors can drive that also runs itself when nobody's there. That answer is what produced
  the four-state machine with a 45-second idle reset.

## Conventions

- Spec-first: brainstormed design → committed spec → implementation plan → code.
- tt-bio is pinned to a **release tag**, never `main` (upstream nightly moves fast).
- Nothing in the UI may ever display a stack trace; every failure path resolves to
  something presentable. See §6 of the spec.
